## **About the Project**

This project is designed to assist individuals with speech disabilities in communicating essential messages using flex sensors. The system involves 5 flex sensors attached to each hand, which are connected to an Arduino Nano. When the sensors are bent, specific messages such as "give me water," "give me food," or "I need help" are played through a loudspeaker. The sounds are stored on an SD card and played using a DFmini module.
